                <h5>Enhanced Digital Photography</h5>
                <p>Do you cover your mouth when you laugh or adopt a reserved smile instead of expressing yourself confidently? Being able to smile freely is essential for your overall well-being. To initiate your smile transformation, one of our experienced professionals will take a detailed photograph of your current smile. This enables you to identify areas for improvement and allows us to provide expert recommendations on the most suitable treatments to enhance your smile.</p>

                <h5>Smile Design Analysis</h5>
                <p>This is your opportunity to specify precisely what you envision for your smile. We start the design process with a clear understanding of your desired outcome, integrated with an assessment of your current smile. By leveraging advanced dental techniques and the expertise of our skilled dentists, we can develop a solution that not only looks exceptional but also considers functionality, health, and biological factors. Whether you prefer braces, porcelain veneers, teeth whitening, or a combination of these options, we will craft a personalized blueprint to transform your dream smile into reality.</p>

This allows you to review and request any final adjustments—such as color or tooth shape—ensuring that every detail meets your expectations before we proceed with the actual treatment.</p>

                <h4>Q&A</h4>
                <h5>How Long Will It Take?</h5>
                <p>Your smile design is meticulously customized to meet your individual needs. Depending on the desired changes, your treatment plan may involve a combination of teeth whitening, veneers, orthodontics, and cosmetic bonding, each with its own timeframe. While this makes it difficult to provide an exact duration, you can be confident that your personalized plan will achieve the smile you’ve always envisioned. Typically, the process for veneers alone takes about 2-3 weeks from the beginning of the design phase.</p>

                <h5>What Are Veneers?</h5>
                <p>Veneers are thin, custom-made shells that cover the front surface of your teeth to address issues with shape, size, or color. Typically crafted from high-quality porcelain, each veneer is uniquely designed to match your individual dental aesthetics and needs. This personalization ensures that your veneers blend seamlessly with your natural smile.</p>

                <h5>Why Wong & Sim Dental?</h5>
                <p>There are many elements that make up the ‘perfect’ smile, some you might already be aware of, such as symmetry and the ideal shape and size of teeth. However, our cosmetic dentists have an extraordinary checklist of factors to consider when designing your new smile:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smile symmetry</li>
                    <li>Shape of teeth</li>
                    <li>Size of teeth</li>
                    <li>Gum levels</li>
                    <li>Angle of teeth</li>
                    <li>Spaces between teeth</li>
                    <li>Reflection of light</li>
                    <li>‘Dark corridors’ at the side of the mouth</li>
                    <li>Lip posture – how much tooth you show when smiling and at rest</li>
                    <li>Translucency</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When all of these elements are taken into consideration, our dentists can design a natural-looking smile that you will be proud to show off at every opportunity.</p>
